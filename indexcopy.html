			I am a student at Washington University in St. Louis studying computer science and biology. My primary academic interests are in genomics and computational biology. 
			Currently, I work at the Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology for <a href="http://mblab.wustl.edu/index.html">Dr. Michael Brent</a>, 
			a Professor of Computer Science, Genetics, and Biomedical Engineering at WashU. 
			As a member of the Brent Lab, I build pipelines for analysis of RNA-Seq data, and look for novel genetic interactions in yeast.
			<br>
			<br>
			When I have long weekends, or more than a few days off, I enjoy exploring cities. Check out <a href="cityscapes.html">Cityscapes</a> for some
			fun places to visit!
			<br>
			<br>
			I don't get as much opportunity as I'd like, but I love reading. I just finished <i>White Teeth</i> by Zadie Smith, am currently on 
			<i>Giovanni's Room</i> by James Baldwin, and have Kazuo Ishiguro's <i>Never Let Me Go</i> next on the list. Click <a href="books.html">here</a> 
			to find reviews of some books I recently read.
