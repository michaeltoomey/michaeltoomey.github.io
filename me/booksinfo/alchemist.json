		"review": "The Alchemist is simultaneously heartwarming and inspiring. Coelho's ideas about the interconnectedness of all things speak to a love for life and its mysteries. Nothing, to him, is unknowable. He also constantly advocates chasing your dreams, and that it is possible to follow your heart and have no need to fear, that it is in fact one's purpose in life to do so. His words are inspiring, and his prose is thoroughly enjoyable."
