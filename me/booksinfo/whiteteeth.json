		"<b><i>White Teeth</i> by Zadie Smith</b><br /><b>Published</b>: 1999<br /><b>Genre</b>: Fiction, Novel<br /><b>Review</b>: A wonderful book that will leave any Chicagoan with much civic pride. It was incredibly interesting to see how the actions of men more than 100 years ago affect the city today. Absolutely entertaining and Erik Larson's style of writing never ceased to amuse me. He made this historical non-fiction read like a novel.";
