<h1>Mike Toomey</h1>

<p>
I'm a student at Washington University in St. Louis studying computer science and biology. Currently, I work at the Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology for <a href="http://mblab.wustl.edu/index.html">Dr. Michael Brent</a>, a Professor of Computer Science, Genetics, and Biomedical Engineering at WashU. 
My primary interests are in genomics and computational biology, and as a member of the Brent Lab, I build pipelines for analysis of RNA-Seq data, and look for novel genetic interactions in yeast.
