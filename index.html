<p>
I am a student at Washington University in St. Louis studying computer science and biology. My primary academic interests are in genomics and computational biology. 
Currently, I work at the Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology for <a href="http://mblab.wustl.edu/index.html">Dr. Michael Brent</a>, 
a Professor of Computer Science, Genetics, and Biomedical Engineering at WashU. 
As a member of the Brent Lab, I build pipelines for analysis of RNA-Seq data, and look for novel genetic interactions in yeast.
