		"review": "Banerjee and Duflo provide a convincing argument for the notion of evidence-based poverty-fighting techniques. They take a scientific perspective on global poverty. I would have liked to see more statistical evidence, rather simple comparisons of means, as well as more discussion of methods and sample sizes. There is a perception that the softer sciences have a reputation for poor statistical power, and the authors did little to dispel this notion. In addition, there is something that seems somewhat morally off about subjecting groups of individuals in impoverished foreign countries to randomized experiments (in this case, to different external aid “treatments”) without their consent, a concept Banerjee and Duflo never discussed. Nevertheless, they often made convincing arguments about the efficacy of different ideas enacted in the past to fight poverty, and have provided a useful framework through which one can examine the issues discussed."
